git recipe practice
This is an assignment on the Odin Project's curriculum.  I am to use basic HTML to create a website containing recipes.  I have done this once before, but I've forgotten a lot of the Git commands to do this.  As such, this is a refresher course to learn more about Git more than it is about learning HTML.
